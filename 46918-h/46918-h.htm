<p>“S<span class="smallerfont">INGLE</span> L<span class="smallerfont">IFE</span>” is
intended as a companion picture to the same author’s Comedy of “M<span
class="smallerfont">ARRIED</span> L<span class="smallerfont">IFE</span>;” and as that
attempted to illustrate a few of the humours of the state matrimonial, and interest an
audience without the introduction of any lovers whatever, in going to the opposite extreme
in “S<span class="smallerfont">INGLE</span> L<span class="smallerfont">IFE</span>,” and
making his characters “<i>Lovers all,</i>” he has been equally successful in pourtraying
some of the vagaries of courtship, and showing that the democratic region of celibacy has
its bickerings, as well as the most loyal one of “The United States.”</p>

Companion”—a very excellent book for youth; but at Mr. Niggle’s age, he ought to possess
<i>his</i> best companion in a devoted and amiable wife; heigho! What a treasure <i>I</i>
should be to any man that could properly understand me. <i>(Takes up another book.)</i>
“The Epistles of Abelard and Heloise.” I am pleased to see this book on his table, it
proves that he possesses a taste for sentiment of the highest order, and can admire
devotedness and passion under the most trying circumstances. “The Newgate Calender.” Bless
the man, what can induce him to have such a book as this in his house; surely he can have
no sympathy with housebreakers and assassins? I must look to this: should I ever be the
mistress here, some of these volumes must be removed—this furniture too—very well for a
bachelor; but when he is married, a change must be made. And those curtains, how slovenly
they are put up. Ah, any one can discover the want of a presiding female hand in a
bachelor’s house—where is the neatness, the order, and the good taste that prevails in all
the arrangements, where the master of the house is a married man. If ever I am Mrs.
Niggle, down shall come those curtains, away shall go that sideboard, off shall go those
chairs, and as for this table—let me look at its legs——<i>(Lifts up the cover and examines

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> Hollo! hollo!</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> Oh! how you frightened me.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> It’s a very suspicious thing when an old maid examines a
bachelor’s furniture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a class="newpage" id="page-8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> Good morning, Mr. Damper, I was merely observing
Mr. Niggle’s table legs.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> (<span class="stage">L</span>.) Ah! when an old maid
finds herself on her own last legs, ’tis time she should observe those of other
people.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> (<span class="stage">L</span>.) What a censorious
man you are, Mr. Damper, you rail at our sex as if you considered it man’s natural enemy,
instead of his best friend. Is it possible that you have never loved a woman in all your
life?</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> I love a woman! Ugh! I look upon you all as the first
great cause of every evil.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> For, like most first great causes, you don’t
understand us.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> If I don’t, I have no wish to acquire any such useless
knowledge. May I ask what you want at my friend Niggle’s, so early in the morning: some
conspiracy, I’ll be bound. I wont allow it, Miss Snare; if you think to inveigle him into
matrimony, you’ll find yourself mistaken; he shall never marry, if I can prevent him
making such a ninny of himself.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> It is entirely through your interference, I have
been told, that he is in a state of celibacy; and, though the poor gentleman is now
fifty-five, yet ever since he arrived at years of discretion, he has been sighing and
pining for a wife.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> He would have been a ruined man long ago, but for me;
five times have I saved him from the matrimonial precipice.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> How did you save him?</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> How? I have discovered his intention to marry, and
knowing how nervous he is upon the subject, I have always interfered in time, told him in
strong language the evils he was bringing upon his head, brought instances of married
misery so plainly before his eyes, that I have frightened him out of his wits; and one
morning, eight years ago, he was actually dressed and on his way to church to unite
himself to some designing woman, when I luckily met him, and dragged him back again by the
collar.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> And he had to pay five hundred pounds damages, in
an action for breach of promise.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> But he purchased independence and happiness with the
money. I have been his best friend through life; didn’t I go out with him when he was
challenged by a young lady’s brother, twenty years ago, because I made him relinquish his
attentions to her? And though he has been shot at and caned, and has paid damages in two
actions for breach of promise, yet by meeting those small evils, he has escaped that far
greater one—<i>a wife;</i> and every morning when he rises a free man, I know he invokes a
blessing on my head. <i>(Sits at table, <span class="stage">L</span>.)</i></p>

I will no longer allow this continued intrusion on my privacy; and, Miss Snare, I do not
wish to offend, but really your continued calls upon <i>me</i>, at all hours, are somewhat
indecorous. The neighbours begin to talk, and I must check them. What may you want this
morning?</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> I am sure, sir, I was not aware that my friendly
visits could cause anybody to talk, or at least be annoying to you; however, I shall not
intrude again—you know why I called yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> To give me a pincushion, made by yourself, in the form
of a heart.</p>

<p><span class="name">Dam.</span> A dead set at you, John, clear as daylight—a dead set at
you. Oh! miss, I’m ashamed of you.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sna.</span> For what, sir? He complained, a few days since,
that he was without a pincushion, and could never recollect to purchase one; and where was
the harm, sir, in my supplying such a trifling want: I shall not be so attentive
<i>again</i>, be assured. As for my call this morning, it was on parish business—a motive
of charity; but since my little acts of friendship are so sternly checked, of course those
of charity must suffer at the same time. And I did hope to have your company to tea,
to-morrow.</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> Well, well, I know and appreciate your motives; but you
always contrive to call when I’m occupied, when I don’t want to be disturbed—and
<i>this</i> morning, I particularly wish to be quite alone. <i>(Double knock without.)</i>
Another call! Dear, dear, that is the worst of being a bachelor; everybody walks into his
house whenever they please—no announcement, no ceremony, in they bounce with—“How are you?
how do? only <i>me</i>.” And sit themselves down, and take up this, and throw down that.
Oh, I wish I had the courage to take a wife. <i>(Looking at his watch.)</i> How the time

your feelings. Oh, you sly man, do you think your attentions to Miss Coy, have passed
unnoticed. Gallanting her home from parties, running of errands for her, sitting on a post
opposite to her window of an evening, when the weather has been mild enough, taking walks,
and taking tea, and playing at double dummy by moonlight. Oh, shocking! shocking!
<i>(Sings.)</i> “Can love be controlled by advice? Will Cupid his mother obey.”</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> Pray don’t be musical at such a moment, miss, pray,
don’t. <i>One</i> shakes her head and cries “shocking,” another ejaculates “dreadful,”
while Damper sums up all by a growl of “horrible,” and giving a violent hint of Miss Coy
and some full grown young man. Now, what is it? Not that I particularly wish to know;
because curiosity is a foible that I detest. Not that it at all concerns me, the least in
the world—the least in the world. What is it?</p>

are: I am your friend you know, and I’ll never forsake you.</p>

<p><span class="name">Miss Sky.</span> Nay, Mr. Damper, if his fancy <i>is</i> fixed
there, why should he not gratify it? Miss Coy is still a handsome woman, past the summer
of her existence, certainly; but what I call a fine autumnal maiden.</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> So she is; and if I <i>do</i> possess a preference for
any female, I certainly admire one at that season of life: when her charms are in the
richest state of perfection. None of your just budding April misses for me; who, after
all, may turn out to be very indifferent blossoms.</p>

Mr. Niggle, the strangest bit of gossip you ever heard—while I was at my tailor’s,

well, well, if you don’t choose to tell me, keep the matter to yourself; why call here
dropping your hints? Why should I concern <i>myself</i> about that lady, or what may be
said of her? hey? eh? Ah, indeed, why? As for you, Mr. David, listen to me: it was all
very well and very kind of you to concern yourself about me when I was young and
thoughtless; but now I am at an age to judge for myself, your interference in my affairs
is very officious; and, in future, sir, I shall do as I like, marry if I like, drown
myself if I like, and if I <i>do</i> the latter thing, sir, I shall consider it an act of
impertinence if you jump into <i>any</i> pond, in <i>any</i> place, and <i>under</i> any

<p><span class="name">Miss Mac.</span> You should not use such ardent expressions. It is
very unseemly in a young lady to talk of having a passion for anything, whether animate or
inanimate. If you begin with flowers, you may end with the same enthusiasm in behalf of a
human object; and if that object were to be a man, I should tremble for the result!</p>

the candles, and <i>then</i>, eh?</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> No, no, there may seem too much of jest in that.
Contrive some moonlight walk with your lady; or manage to be sitting alone with her on
some lovely autumn evening, in the light of the sinking sun, when all nature seems going
to repose. I popped to my first love on just such an evening, and had to fight her brother
on a wet foggy morning a month afterwards!</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> No, no—every word is of value. She will reply “Indeed it
does”—then in the most pathetic tones you can command, you must add: “For my own part, I
feel its influence so strongly here”—placing the hand you have at liberty on your
heart—“that I could live for ever thus.”</p>

you are to experience at that moment.</p>

<p><span class="name">Pin.</span> Ah, that’s speaking allegorically! Well?</p>

<p><span class="name">Nig.</span> Of course she will make no reply. Then you must be

<p>In general, the spelling, grammar and punctuation of the source text have been
retained, and no attempt has been made to standardize inconsistencies of spelling. For
example, the contraction of “cannot” is printed both as “can’t” and “cant”. In a few
cases, minor adjustments were made to the formatting for the sake of consistency. In
addition, in cases where the printed text was judged to have printing or typographical
errors, the text was corrected.</p>
